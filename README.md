# Astro/Physics 600 (Fall 2023)

This is the Github repository for the common parts of the Astro/Physics 600 
class for Fall 2023.

This is a work-in-progress. I am also going to err on the side of keeping outlines
current, even if incomplete.

Much of these notes are directly from/derived from many different sources. 
An incomplete bibliography/reference list is below, apologies for sources missed.

# Bibliography

## Primary Textbooks

- Cosmology, Daniel Baumann

### Background Expansion

- [The Friedmann Models and Optical Observations in Cosmology, Gunn](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1978obco.meet....1G/abstract) : This 
set of lecture notes from 1978 are worth perusing. A lot of what we discussed in the first lecture are in the first few pages here (although
this is not where I got them from)
- [Distance Measures in Cosmology, Hogg](https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9905116.pdf)
- [The K-Correction, Hogg et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210394)
- [Expanding Confusion..., Davis and Lineweaver](https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0310808.pdf)
